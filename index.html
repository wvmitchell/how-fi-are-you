        The journey of 1000 miles begins with a single step.
        You're here, so congratulations on taking the first step!
        With discipline and hard work, you can be FI to. It starts today!
      </p>
      <p id="fi-summary-1" class="fi-summary inactive">
        You're on the path, way to go! It can be hard to see 
        the top of the mountian when you've just started. Don't 
        forget to celebrate the small wins along the way. You're 
        already closer to FI than you were when you started!
      </p>
      <p id="fi-summary-2" class="fi-summary inactive">
        You're over half way to FI! You'll really start to feel 
        the acceration now! Your foundation is solidly built, just 
        make sure you're keeping your eyes on the prize.
      </p>
      <p id="fi-summary-3" class="fi-summary inactive">
        You're so close! Getting this far has taken sacrifice, 
        determination, and attention to detail. You're not there 
        yet, but a life of financial independence is getting close!
      </p>
      <p id="fi-summary-4" class="fi-summary inactive">
        You've done it, you've reached FI! Your time is now your own. 
        Using the lessons that you've learned along the way, you 
        should never need to do work you find unsatisfying again. 
        How can you give back to this community?
